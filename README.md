## Covid-19 Project
The goal of this project is to analyse some Covid-19 data and try to create useful models that can predict, classify or cluster data and gain new insights from it.

### Analysis part
First we will find out if there is any missing data in the dataset, if there is we will fill those gaps with certain data so that we can analyse it properly. After that, we are going to explore the features of the data and try to find out if there is anything that can help us to
can help us with the modelling. We will also analyse some data about Covid-19 in Finland.

### Modelling part
For continuous value prediction we will use XGBoost Regression model and for class classification we will use XGBoost Classifier model. For clustering we
will use k-means algorithm.

### Final part
After the modelling part, we will analyse the modelling results and try to find some useful insights that can be used in the real world.
